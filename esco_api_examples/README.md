# ESCO API examples

Examples of requests to the [ESCO API](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/api), e.g. to get skills of a particular occupation or to find out which occupations have a particular skill (see the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder).

The notebook `ESCO_occupation_hierarchy.ipynb` can be used to reconstruct ESCO's occupational hierarchy, whereas `ESCO_skills_hierarchy.ipynb` constructs the hierarchy of skills published by ESCO in May 2020 (read more on the latter on the [ESCO website](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/escopedia/Skills_pillar)).
